## Performance comparaison of GPU and CPU

### Project overview

This project compares the performance of CPU and GPU while training a simple neural network with binary classification data. The neural network is implemented using PyTorch and trained to classify signal vs. background events. The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy and precision (for both positive and negative classes). The training process is made on both CPU and GPU for increasing batch sizes to observe their impact on training time and performance.

### Installation requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

    Python 3
    PyTorch
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn
    Matplotlib
    Uproot
    Seaborn

Additionally, you will need to have a GPU available if you want to run the model on a GPU.
